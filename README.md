Once you click and answer the screen will be updated again with a new question and selection of answers. After all five questions have been answered you will be shown your score and prompted to enter your initials. This information is stored locally and then displayed to you on the high scores screen. You will have the option to return to the main screen or to clear the high scores.

At any point in time you can get to the high scores screen by clicking the text "View Highscores" in the upper left hand side of the screen.
